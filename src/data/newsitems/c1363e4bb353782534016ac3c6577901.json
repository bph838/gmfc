          "The Club have received a number of enquiries about joining Gordano Model Flying Club to use the RC track facilities. Details for ‘track only members (non Flying)’ are currently being finalised by the committee. We plan to admit new members in the Spring after the Club April AGM. Any new applications will be added to a waiting list until then.",
          "Visitors wishing to visit and view track facilities are welcome, but must contact the club in advance to arrange a suitable date. A committee member will act as host for their visit.",
          "Junior members (under 18) will aways require their parent/guardian to accompany them."
